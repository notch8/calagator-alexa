Coderetreat.org is a self-organized, volunteer led organization dedicated to helping software developers help each other improve their craft. Tanya Crenshaw and Jean Richardson will be teaming up to facilitate PDXWIT's 2016 Coderetreat. The Tech Academy is donating space and providing breakfast and lunch for the event.  Come along for a day of codeplay in a supportive environment and help Coderetreat follow the sun during the global celebration of software development!\r\n\r\nHere's how it works: SW developers of all sorts gather together with their machines and IDE's ready to code Conway's Game of Life for 45 minute sessions. Pairs change with every 45 minute iteration so everyone gets exposed to different problem solving strategies, and everyone learns together:  newbies and master-craft persons alike. There is no expectation to finish coding Conway's Game of Life at any point during the day. \r\n\r\nThe purpose is to learn coding problem solving strategies, share skills and experience pairing in a supportive environment. \r\n\r\nPDXWIT a community-based non-profit organization with the purpose of strengthening the Portland women in tech community through educational programs, partnerships and events that provide information, connections, resources, opportunities, and a supportive environment for current and potential women in tech, all of whom are committed to helping each other. Our goal is to bring together and empower current women in tech and encourage others to pursue tech careers to help reduce gender imbalance in the industry and address the current negative effects of that imbalance on women.\r\n","start_time":"2016-10-22T08:00:00.000-07:00","url":"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pdx-women-in-techpdxwit-coderetreat-2016-tickets-27661828273","created_at":"2016-09-11T20:21:19.000-07:00","updated_at":"2016-09-11T20:21:19.000-07:00","venue_id":202395068,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"end_time":"2016-10-22T17:00:00.000-07:00","version":null,"rrule":null,"venue_details":"","locked":false,"venue":{"id":202395068,"title":"The Tech Academy","description":"","address":"310 SW 4th Ave Suite 412 Portland, OR 97204","url":"http://www.learncodinganywhere.com","created_at":"2015-09-17T14:32:01.000-07:00","updated_at":"2016-08-09T19:48:38.083-07:00","street_address":"310 SW 4th Ave Suite 412","locality":"Portland","region":"OR","postal_code":"97204","country":"USA","latitude":"45.52085","longitude":"-122.6749","email":"info@learncodinganywhere.com","telephone":"5032066915","source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":false,"access_notes":"","events_count":24}},{"id":1250470819,"title":"PDX Global Day of Coderetreat 2016","description":"Come join your fellow Portland coders to practice the art of software development together.

Moving to an immutable infrastructure provided good support for a zero downtime setup and for standardizing the development environments as well as easy scaling. However, the transition also encountered challenges, which Hannes and Michael will address during their talk. If you are interested to learn about the process, the benefits and the pitfalls, join their talk about dockerizing Django. \r\n\r\nThere should be time for lightning talks after the presentation. If you have something you want to share, come prepared to give a 5 minute talk.

Cyclists are welcome to park their bikes in the New Relic office. Bikes are not allowed in the building lobby, however, and must use the freight elevator. To get your bike up to the 29th floor, enter the building's parking lot by going down the ramp at 5th and Pine. Go past the booth -- no need to pick up a ticket -- and turn right. Go straight until you almost run into the elevator lobby, then go right again. On the back side of the elevator block you'll see a beat up pair of double doors marked \"freight elevator.\" You can get up by buzzing in with the intercom, and saying you're here for New Relic. Ride on up to the 29th floor, you'll easily find the bike parking.\r\n\r\nABOUT THE GROUP: *The Portland Ruby Brigade, also known as pdxruby and pdx.rb, is a user group for Ruby programmers in the Portland, Oregon area. The group welcomes all programmers interested in the language and its implementations, tools, libraries and frameworks, such as Ruby on Rails. The group has been meeting since August 2002 for presentations, demos and discussions. Every month 35-75 people come together to share their knowledge, projects and enthusiasm for Ruby. If you'd like to present or have a topic you'd like discussed, please post to the mailing list. The group usually meets on the first Tuesday of the month, \"Ruby Tuesday\" -- see you there!*\r\n","start_time":"2016-11-01T18:00:00.000-07:00","url":"http://pdxruby.org/","created_at":"2016-10-18T15:35:19.000-07:00","updated_at":"2016-10-18T15:35:19.000-07:00","venue_id":202392091,"source_id":null,"duplicate_of_id":null,"end_time":"2016-11-01T22:00:00.000-07:00","version":null,"rrule":null,"venue_details":"","locked":false,"venue":{"id":202392091,"title":"New Relic","description":"The *29th* floor of Big Pink, one floor down from the City Grill.","address":"","url":"","created_at":"2010-07-02T10:54:09.000-07:00","updated_at":"2014-07-01T13:07:41.000-07:00","street_address":"111 SW 5th Avenue, Suite 2900","locality":"Portland","region":"Oregon","postal_code":"97204","country":"United States","latitude":"45.52246","longitude":"-122.676","email":"","telephone":"","source_id":996334371,"duplicate_of_id":null,"closed":false,"wifi":true,"access_notes":"Check in at the security desk to get access to the 29th floor.

Which should I buy? Can I build it myself? The CIS Critical Security Controls are a prioritized approach to ensuring information security. As a general risk assessment, the Critical Security Controls address the past, current and expected attacks occurring across the Internet. In this course we will outline the controls, discuss implementation and testing, and provide examples.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nIntroduction to Injection Vulnerabilities\r\n---\r\nInstructor: Timothy D. Morgan\r\nEver concatenated strings in your code? Did those strings include any kind of structured syntax? Then your code might be vulnerable to injection. Injection flaws are broad, common category of vulnerability in modern software. While many developers are aware of high-profile technical issues, such as SQL injection, any number of injection vulnerabilities are possible in other languages, protocols, and syntaxes. Upon studying these flaws in many contexts, an underlying \"theory of injection\" emerges. This simple concept can be applied to many situations (including new technologies and those yet to be invented) to help developers avoid the most common types of implementation vulnerabilities. The reason why \"injection\" is #1 on the OWASP Top 10 will become very clear by the end of this class. This course will provide students a detailed introduction to injection vulnerabilities and then get students busy with hands-on exercises where a variety of different injection flaws can be explored and understood in real-world contexts.\r\n\r\nAfternoon Session\r\n===\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nApplied Physical Attacks on Embedded Systems, Introductory Version\r\n---\r\nThis workshop introduces several different relatively accessible interfaces on embedded systems. Attendees will get hands-on experience with UART, SPI, and JTAG interfaces on a MIPS-based wifi router. After a brief architectural overview of each interface, hands-on labs will guide through the process understanding, observing, interacting with, and exploiting the interface to potentially access a root shell on the target.\r\n\u003cbr\u003e\r\nCommunications Security in Modern Software\r\n---\r\nSecuring communications over untrusted networks is a critical component to any modern application's security. However, far too often developers and operations personnel become tripped up by the many pitfalls of implementation in this area, which often leads to complete failures to secure data on the wire. In this course we discuss how attackers can gain access to other users' communication through a variety of techniques and cover the strategies for preventing this. The course covers specific topics ranging from the SSL/TLS certificate authority system, to secure web session management and mobile communications security. A hands-on exercise is included in the course which helps students empirically test SSL/TLS certificate validation in a realistic scenario.\r\n\r\n\u003chr\u003e\r\nAbout OWASP\r\n===\r\nThe Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a 501c3 not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software.

James Aimonetti has created a workshop to show PDX Women In Tech members the tech behind telecom.\r\n\r\nAgenda for the workshop:\r\n\r\n - A brief history of telecom\r\n - Describe VoIP at high level\r\n - Show some SIP packets for basic call scenarios\r\n        - Introduce basic jargon and acronym\r\n        - Compare SIP to HTTP\r\n - Describe high level distributed architecture of Kazoo\r\n        - Identify and eliminate single points of failure\r\n        - Coordinate call processing among servers\r\n        - Highlight challenges in distributing everything\r\n - Brief pitch for developing against Kazoo\r\n        - REST APIs\r\n        - Pivot - real-time, dynamic call routing\r\n\r\nThis workshop encourages more women to consider telecom as an exciting place where innovation is possible and learn to marry telecom infrastructure to the Internet-driven life in new and novel ways. Come learn a little about telecom, distributed systems as applied to telecom infrastructure, Erlang, and maybe get inspired to build new systems that leverage the APIs exposed in Kazoo.\r\n\r\n\r\nPDXWIT is a community-based non-profit organization. Our purpose is to strengthen the Portland women in tech community by offering: educational programs, partnerships, mentorships, resources and opportunities. We are unifying a supportive environment for current and potential women in tech, all of whom are committed to helping each other. Our goal is to bring together and empower women in tech and to encourage others to pursue tech careers. This is our step towards reducing the gender imbalance in the industry and addressing the current negative effects of that imbalance on women.

Dani Schulte will be teaching volunteers how to manually disassemble computers, peripheral electronic devices, and other electronic hardware. \r\n\r\nManual disassembly is important for 2 main reasons: \r\n\r\n1. Significantly reduces landfill-bound waste from electronics in comparison to mechanized recycling done by for-profit recycling operations. \r\n\r\n2. Produces high-quality separated metals.\r\n\r\nAgenda:\r\n\r\nDani will do a brief orientation with you when you arrive at 3:30pm. Must read, fill out, and sign the Volunteer Application  (unless you have volunteered here before). The Group Volunteer Form  must also be filled out. All the required forms will be emailed to the volunteers closer to the event.
